Instructions for Playing the Game

Welcome to my version of the arcade game Frogger. I hope that you'll have fun playing the game.

At the beginning of the game, you can press "p" to select a character to play the game. Keep pressing "p" to cycle through the list of characters you can choose. Then, press "s" to start the game.

The game keeps track of your score. You can score 1 point when you reach the lake area. The game will transport your player to the starting position after touching the water. You can also score 2 points when you touch the gems that appear intermittently. Be careful of the bugs--they will reduce your score by 1 point. When your score goes below zero, the game is over.
